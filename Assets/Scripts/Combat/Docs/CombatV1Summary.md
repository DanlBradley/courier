# Combat System V1 - Final Summary

## Implementation Status: ✅ Complete

### Core Features Implemented
- **Physics-based melee combat** with velocity-based damage calculation
- **Animation-driven attack timing** using Unity animation events
- **Hitbox activation system** with precise timing windows
- **Team-based hit validation** preventing friendly fire
- **First-person weapon animations** with proper hand rig setup
- **Modular weapon architecture** supporting different weapon types
- **Debug tools** including TestDummy for combat validation

## Architecture Overview

### GameObject Hierarchy
```
Player (CombatController, CharacterStatus, Rigidbody)
├── Main Camera
└── RightHand (Animator, AnimationEventRelay)
    └── RustySword (MeleeWeaponController)
        ├── Model (Mesh)
        ├── Blade (Collider - IsTrigger)
        └── Tip (Collider - IsTrigger)
```

### Component Responsibilities

#### CombatController
- Manages combat state (attacking, blocking, energy)
- Handles input for player characters
- Triggers animations on child Animator
- Auto-detects weapon in children
- Processes damage dealing and receiving

#### WeaponController (Abstract)
- Velocity tracking for physics-based damage
- Hit detection via OnTriggerEnter
- Hitbox management (enable/disable)
- Damage calculation with modifiers
- Multi-hit prevention per swing

#### MeleeWeaponController
- Concrete implementation for melee weapons
- Trail effect management
- Environmental hit effects
- Debug logging when enabled

#### AnimationEventRelay
- Bridges animation events to CombatController
- Lives on GameObject with Animator (RightHand)
- Forwards hitbox activation/deactivation events

#### TestDummy
- IDamageable implementation for testing
- Verbose damage logging
- Visual feedback on hits
- Health tracking

### Animation Pipeline

1. **Input** → CombatController.HandlePrimaryAttack()
2. **Validation** → Energy check, state check
3. **Animation Trigger** → Animator.SetTrigger("Attack")
4. **Animation Events** (in .anim file):
   - ~25%: OnAttackHitboxActive
   - ~70%: OnAttackHitboxInactive
   - ~95%: OnAttackComplete
5. **Event Relay** → AnimationEventRelay → CombatController
6. **Hitbox Control** → WeaponController.ActivateHitbox()
7. **Hit Detection** → OnTriggerEnter → ProcessHit
8. **Damage Application** → IDamageable.TakeDamage()

### Key Interfaces

- **IDamageable**: Entities that can take damage
- **IDamageDealer**: Entities that can deal damage
- **IWeapon**: Weapon behavior contract
- **ICombatService**: Combat logic and validation

## Performance Optimizations Applied

1. **Component Caching**: Rigidbody and WeaponController cached in Awake()
2. **Removed Debug Logs**: Production logging removed, kept conditional debug
3. **Efficient Hitbox Management**: Colliders only active during attack windows
4. **Velocity Calculation**: Only computed in FixedUpdate when attacking

## Configuration

### CombatConfig (ScriptableObject)
- Base stats (attack power, defense, speed)
- Energy costs (light attack: 10, heavy: 25)
- Combat behavior parameters

### WeaponDefinition (ScriptableObject)
- Weapon stats (damage, speed, weight)
- Attack patterns and combos
- Audio/visual assets
- Status effect IDs

## Known Limitations (V1)

1. **Single Weapon**: No weapon switching implemented
2. **Basic Combos**: Combo system foundation exists but not fully utilized
3. **No Blocking**: Blocking methods exist but not hooked up to input
4. **No Ranged**: Only melee weapons supported
5. **Basic AI**: No AI combat behavior implemented

## Debug Features

- **MeleeWeaponController.debugHits**: Toggle hit logging
- **TestDummy.verboseLogging**: Detailed damage reports
- **Animation Events**: Visual in Animation window

## Next Steps for V2

1. **Combat Features**:
   - Implement combo chains
   - Add blocking/parrying mechanics
   - Weapon switching system
   - Ranged weapon support

2. **Polish**:
   - Hit pause/time freeze
   - Camera shake on impact
   - Damage numbers UI
   - Better particle effects

3. **AI Combat**:
   - Enemy attack patterns
   - Dodge/block behaviors
   - Combat state machines
